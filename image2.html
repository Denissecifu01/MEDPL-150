    <p>This image that I captured in my vacation in my homeland colombia at night time and the beauty of the urban landscape from a high vintage point. 
    It was beautiful how being from the mountain allowed me to capture the glowing lights of the streets and buildings. In this image, I adjusted the tonal range
    creating the sky darker that way the city lights outstand more in the image and grab the attention of the viewer.</p>
