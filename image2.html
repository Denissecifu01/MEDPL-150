        I chose this photo of my city in Colombia at night because it captures the beauty and energy of the urban landscape from a high vantage point. 
        Shooting from Mountain View allowed me to include the glowing lights of the streets and buildings, creating depth and a sense of scale. 
        I applied the rule of thirds to position the brightest areas strategically, drawing the viewer’s eye across the city. Cropping helped remove distractions and focus on the most visually striking parts of the scene. 
        Adjusting the tonal range with Levels and Curves enhanced the contrast between the dark sky and the illuminated city, making the lights pop and giving the image a more vibrant, atmospheric feel. This photo represents a personal connection to my hometown while also highlighting the beauty that can be found in everyday urban life.
