    <h1> Denisse's MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
    <h2> Creative statament</h2>
    <p> Hi, my name is Denisse CIfuentes. I am currently majoring in Translator and interpreter. Mainly focused on spanish and englihs. 
      I was born in Colombia and later moved to the united states of the age of 2. My creation at started from a young age, Being able to transmit my feelings and ideas on to art is very fun and interesting. 
I have a small business where I create handmade accessories, For me being able to create acessories as my art 
      is not just for it to look beautiful but also the meaning behind each pearl used in the acesssories I create. 
      Art is like a safe place, with simple materials how they transform into something meaningful.As a form of communication and interaction
      
      My small handmade business grew out of the love I have for art. It's like a way for me to show art in each piece created careully. Since 
      I started my business it has also taught me that art is more than a personal passion, it connects with customers with different cultures that value authenticity
      and creativity. Which is something that keeps me to keep improving and experimenting with new materials everyday. I like being able to express myself through the colors 
      of the beads and being able to transmit feelings through the colors if either light colors or dark colors. It is very interesing. In the MEDPL 150 my main goal is to be able to learn about coding and learn to edit images
    and be ablet to transmit it all in my own webpage which is very interesting. Also, want to be able to develop a good skill and knowledge in the visual communication and art.</p>
    
    <h3>Reflection<h3>
      <p>Throoughout the class, it was a little hard for me keeping track on how to set up my page but then after
        some minutes I was able to complete all the tasks of creating my own webpage. I am still adapting to understanding a little on the symbols needed to include in the folders and 
        how i need to make sure to add the correct symbols because if not it can be an error. After looking at the tutorial it became more helpful for me as i would pause the video and continue.When it came to the angle brakets it was the moment were I had the most issue's because 
      if i didn't close them correctly then it will mess up everything up which that's not the idea at all. <p>
