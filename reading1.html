    <h1>Reading 1: Susan Sontag, "In Plato's Cave"</h1>

    <p>In the reading <em>On Photography</em> by Susan Sontag, I was able to reflect on how she uses Plato’s famous allegory of the cave to explain the role of photography in shaping how we see the world. Sontag suggests that photographs can make us feel “trapped” in a kind of cave because we rely on them so heavily to understand reality. This was interesting to me because I grew up with my parents filming every special moment since I was a baby, and being able to go back and rewatch those videos always makes me feel grateful. At the same time, it shows how powerful images can be in shaping how we remember our lives.</p>

    <p>One of Sontag’s main points is that photographs only capture a small piece of reality, and it’s up to us to interpret what that piece means. A photo can feel like proof of reality, even though it leaves out so much context. I connected with this because there are many times when I scroll through Instagram and see someone post about their culture. Even though I’ve never experienced it firsthand, just by looking at the image I feel like I understand something about it. This shows how photographs give us access to worlds we might not otherwise know, but they also simplify those experiences.</p>

    <p>Another point that stood out to me was how people often take pictures of events just to prove they were there. I realized that I unconsciously do this all the time. This past summer, when I traveled to one of my dream destinations in Italy, I took pictures of everything—places I visited, the food I ate, the towns I explored. When I came back to New York, those photos became proof that I had lived those moments. They weren’t just memories; they were evidence I could show my family and friends. In that sense, the photo itself becomes the reality people remember.</p>

    <p>Sontag also talks about how some photographs go beyond personal memories and become part of society’s history. For example, the tragic events of 9/11 are remembered through the iconic images of the Twin Towers burning and people covered in ash on the streets. Those photos didn’t just capture what happened—they shaped how we continue to recall that day. A more recent example is the coronavirus pandemic. Photographs of empty city streets and exhausted doctors and nurses became symbols of what the world went through. These images don’t just document events; they define how we collectively remember them.</p>

    <p>Overall, this reading made me think more deeply about the meaning of photographs. I realized that an image is never just a simple snapshot—it carries emotions, perspectives, and interpretations that shape both personal and collective memory. Going forward, I want to be more intentional when I capture moments, knowing that each photo I take is not only a memory for myself but also a way of framing reality for others.</p>
