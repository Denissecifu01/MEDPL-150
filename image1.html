        I captured this photo with the camera because it focuses on one word, the word Exit.I applied the rule of thirds to place the main subject right in the center, creating a natural flow for the viewer’s eye. Leading lines guide attention toward the focal point, and cropping removed distractions to emphasize depth and clarity.
        I also Adjusted the tonal range making the exit letter outstand more with a neon reddish color, and the Curves helped bring out a little bit of shadow behind the sign and creating like an outlined highlights, enhancing contrast and making the colors pop without overdoing it.
