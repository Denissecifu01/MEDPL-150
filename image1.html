        I chose this photo of the exit signal because it felt simple but meaningful, capturing a moment of direction and movement.
        I wanted to focus on the clear lines and shape of the sign, which naturally guided the viewer’s eye across the frame. I applied the rule of thirds to position the signal off-center, creating balance and a sense of flow. 
        Cropping removed distractions from the background, emphasizing the structure of the sign and its surroundings. Adjusting the tonal range with Levels and Curves helped bring out the contrast between the sign and its environment, making the image feel clearer and more visually striking. 
        Overall, I chose this photo because it represents a small detail from everyday life that can convey guidance and order when framed thoughtfully.
