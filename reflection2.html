        Working on this assignment gave me a much deeper appreciation for the technical and creative aspects of photography. Before, I mostly thought about taking photos as a way to capture moments and memories , but now I see how much thought goes into composition, cropping, and tonal adjustments. 
        Shooting multiple images around the school and selecting the strongest ones made me pay attention to details I usually overlook, like balance, depth, and leading lines. 
        I realized that even small changes in framing or angle can completely change how a photo communicates an idea or feeling. </p>

        Editing the images in Photoshop was another eye-opening experience. Using adjustment layers, levels, and curves taught me how to enhance tonal range without affecting the original photo which is very interesting.
        It was interesting to see how shadows, midtones, and highlights can shift the mood of a picture, making it feel more vivid or the colors making something outstand more in the image. I also learned the importance of working non destructively, so I can always go back and tweak my edits without losing the original image. </p>

        Through this process, I gained a stronger understanding of how photography is both a technical skill and a form of storytelling. It’s not just about capturing what is in front. it’s about thinking critically, experimenting, and conveying meaning.
        I really look forward to applying these skills in future projects to communicate ideas or sahre moments more effectively and create images that have a clear intention and impact.
